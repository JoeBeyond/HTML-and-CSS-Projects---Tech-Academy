<h1><u>BACON DEETS</u></h1>

<details>
  <summary>Bacon</summary>
  <p>Bacon can come from a pig's belly, back or sides - essentially anywhere that has
	an exceptionally high fat content. In the United Kingdom, back bacon is most common,
	but Americans are more familiar with "streaky" bacon, also known as side bacon,
	which is cut from pork belly.</p>
